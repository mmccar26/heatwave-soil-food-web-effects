Data:
ambient_temp_final.csv
heatwave_temp_final.csv

File descriptions (alphabetical order):

ambient_temp_final.csv:  Predator (rove beetle) and prey (Collembola) abundance data in the microcosm experiment. This data reflects the ambient temperature trials.

heatwave_temp_final.csv:  Predator (rove beetle) and prey (Collembola) abundance data in the microcosm experiment. This data reflects the heatwave temperature trials.

soil_predator_prey_analysis_FINAL.R:  The underlying R code to perform the analysis that examines the impact of temperature and land-use on prey and predator abundance. This code requires importing files "ambient_temp_final.csv" and “heatwave_temp_final.csv” to run.

Note: All R files must be imported into your working directory for the analysis to work.
